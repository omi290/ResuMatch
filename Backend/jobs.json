Candidates will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Please apply early.\n\nAbout Us\n\nMotive International (www.motiveinternational.com) is not like most Federal contractors. We are a social enterprise with a hybrid for-profit/not-for-profit business model focused entirely on a mission to mitigate global conflict and instability. We implement programs and deliver innovative, technology-enabled solutions to public and private sector clients and conduct pro-bono impact initiatives all around the world that help make societies more peaceful and prosperous. Our small team is comprised of passionate, world-leading experts and motivated professionals who believe deeply in our mission and values. We are a certified 8(a) and Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) based in Washington, DC with a reputation for excellence, integrity, and fearlessly pursuing our mission.\n\nAbout The Position\n\nWe are immediately seeking a highly motivated consultant to accelerate our digital transformation by building and maintaining low-code applications, incorporating generative-AI and LLM tools to create and run live Tabletop Exercises (TTX) and support other company initiatives such as Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), data analytics, training events, and business process improvement. You’ll partner closely with colleagues who are subject matter experts in Motive’s core mission areas, including global security and stability, irregular warfare, non-proliferation, security cooperation, international trade and development, and M&E to build and deliver high-impact TTXs and technology solutions that enable Motive to advance our mission to mitigate global conflict and instability. This role demands technical fluency, creativity, and ability to take a proactive role translating the goals and missions of Motive’s primary clients into tech-enabled solutions. Our primary clients and partners include the U.S. military, State Department, foreign governments, and civil society stakeholders who directly shape global security and stability.\n\nOur ideal candidate brings hands-on experience building low-code applications that incorporate generative AI, data analytic, and multimedia elements. This individual will work closely with Motive’s client program teams to develop responsive and engaging tools primarily used in client/partner-facing tabletop exercises (TTXs), wargame scenarios, and classroom-based adult learning, and secondarily in internal-facing business process tasks.\n\nThis is primarily a remote position but involves occasional travel for 5 to 10 days at a time to client sites such as Fort Bragg, NC; Washington, DC; and potentially international locations. Applicants must be U.S. citizens with a valid passport and an ability/interest in traveling.\n\nKey Tasks & Responsibilities\n• Design, build, test and maintain multimedia applications that integrate generative AI, scenario logic, data analytics, and interactive experiences.\n• Collaborate with program and content experts to turn strategic requirements into engaging, technically sound applications.\n• Use tools such as AppSheet, Apps Script, Airtable, Bubble, Glide, or Retool to build responsive applications that support planning and training missions.\n• Lead rapid prototyping and iteration sprints, incorporating feedback from teammates and clients.\n• Configure APIs to integrate GenAI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Midjourney, etc. into apps to support automated data analysis, agentic bot interactions, and/or GenAI-created images or text.\n• Serve as lead technologist during on-site delivery of live client events, such as TTXs or wargames, ensuring apps and tools you’ve developed work as planned and bugs are resolved on the fly.\n• Produce clear user guides, conduct virtual trainings, and provide ongoing support to ensure smooth adoption of tools among relevant teammates.\n• Craft or contribute to policies and best practices to ensure the safe, secure, and ethical deployment of new technologies, especially AI.\n• Contribute to business process improvement by identifying opportunities for streamlining, automation, or new software adoption in Motive’s everyday operational workflows.\n• Help the company identify and integrate emerging technologies into the design of client-facing projects and internal operations.\n\nSample Projects/Tasks\n\nTask 1: Motive designs and delivers TTXs for the U.S. government and has developed a beta version of a web-app using Appsheet and Apps Script to run and analyze results in these TTXs. Recently, we started integrating AI/LLMs into these TTXs. We use AI tools like fireflies to transcribe exercise players’ verbal discussions, then tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to analyze and score player performance in the exercise, and other AI-powered analytics workflows to assign scores against a defined rubric and return an array of JSON objects . The consultant hired for this role will be responsible for continual development and refinement of this low-code app platform, which runs on AppSheet and Google Apps Script to intake transcription data, analyze and visualize scores, and generate qualitative but data-rich reports in a format that supports decision-making by policy makers or military leaders. We might also ask the consultant to work with teammates to develop agentic bots or produce video clips or other multimedia “artifacts” used in TTX scenarios with the help of GenAI tools such as ElevenLabs, Midjourney or others.\n\nTask 2: Motive developed a social science framework for assessing the strength and nature of power dynamics within and between organizations and institutions. We teach this framework to policymakers and military clients as a tool for understanding and influencing the human domain. At present, this framework is conceptual and applied through analog/manual data analysis. Recently, our clients have expressed interest in turning this framework into an app that can intake multi-stream data (e.g., news media reports, survey data, interview notes) and render data visualizations or weighted analytics about different human relationships and social networks. We might ask the consultant hired for this role to develop and test such an app by working with social science experts who helped develop the underlying framework.\n\nTask 3: Motive currently uses a variety of software tools to perform common business process workflows, such as issuing travel authorizations and creating expense reports; developing workplans and projecting personnel time allocation using project management software like Monday.com, timekeeping software, and excel. Currently, these tools are not integrated, and our workflows lack automation. We might ask the consultant hired for this role to review our business software stack and implement changes that streamline or automate repetitive business management tasks. This would first involve gaining familiarity with our business and could evolve into a CTO-type role in the company.\n\nRequired Skills And Experience\n• U.S. citizen with valid passport and ability to travel.\n• Genuine interest in Motive's mission to mitigate global conflict and instability. \n• Demonstrated experience designing and building interactive tools, apps, or games. Candidate should be prepared to share examples of previous work and explain their role in creating them.\n• Expertise in Google Appsheet and Apps Script. (Familiarity with Bubble, Glide, Retool, etc. may be accepted instead.)\n• At least 1-3 years demonstrated familiarity with JavaScript. (Basic familiarity with Python strongly preferred.)\n• Proficient in core Google Workspace tools (e.g., Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive) and demonstrated ability to build collaborative workflows using Google Forms, Sheets, Apps Script and administer users and security configurations in Google Workspace Admin Console.\n• Experience developing automated processes & integrations using Google Apps Script and third-party APIs. (Familiarity with OpenAI’s API platform strongly preferred.)\n• Comfortable working in a cloud-native environment with real-time collaboration tools.\n• Familiarity with scenario design, branching logic, and UX in the context of exercises, games, or adult learning.\n• Ability to quickly master new generative AI tools and multimedia platforms as they become commercially available.\n• Excellent proactive communication and collaboration/teamwork skills; comfortable working closely with non-tech savvy teammates on rapid design and prototyping.\n• Mastery of Microsoft Teams and OS365 suite and ability to quickly learn new software tools used in Motive’s internal operations.\n\nAdditional Preferred Qualifications\n• Experience developing creative multimedia content (e.g., videos, AI agent characters, storyboards/scripts for scenario-based exercises).\n• Experience designing/delivering exercises, wargames, or simulations for military/government audiences.\n• Ability to critique existing Department of Defense exercise environments and articulate paths for innovation.\n• Experience supporting compliance with U.S. government cyber and data security standards and policies (e.g., CMMC).\n• SECRET or higher security clearance.\n\nBenefits\n• Flexible schedule and remote-first work model enable great work/life balance\n• Career advancement and professional development opportunities\n• Potential for consultant role to evolve into a full-time, permanent position\n\nTo Apply\n\nWe are looking for a candidate who not only has the technical skills to be successful in this role but who has a genuine interest in Motive's mission and values. We value direct communication, creative thinking, and teamwork. Our work is fast-paced and dynamic. We value colleagues who thrive when presented with the opportunity to solve a new problem for which no clear standards exist. Because we are a geographically dispersed team, we place a premium on proactive communication and people who enjoy working as a team and keeping colleagues informed.\n\nApplications will be processed on a rolling basis but must be received no later than 27 June 2025. Please apply early. We’d like to fill this position quickly. Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.\n• First, please spend some time on our website (www.motiveinternational.com) getting a sense of who we are and what we do.\n• Next, prepare your CV and a brief statement of interest. You will need these to complete the application form.\n• Submit a complete application.\n• Shortlisted candidates may be invited to participate in a structured technical evaluation, including a short problem-solving sprint. This will assess the candidate’s ability to:\n• Understand exercise design requirements\n• Translate those into a functional build plan\n• Collaboratively prototype and refine solutions with Motive’s team.\n• Ideal start date is as soon as 25 June 2025.",
