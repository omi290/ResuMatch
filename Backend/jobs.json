We are also accepting candidates from some countries in Africa and Asia. For the complete list of accepted locations, click here. This work is 100% remote.\n\nLoom Video\n\nWe have created an Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: Loom Video\n\nOverview\n\nJoin our expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We're primarily seeking JavaScript/React developers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better frontend code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!\n\nWhat Will I Be Doing?\n• Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale.\n• Building and evaluating React components, hooks, and modern JavaScript solutions.\n• Solving coding problems and writing functional and efficient JavaScript/React code.\n• Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively.\n• Creating instructions to help others and reviewing code before it goes into the model.\n• Engaging in a variety of projects, from evaluating code snippets to developing full mobile applications using chatbots.\n\nPay Rates\n\nCompensation rates average at $30/hr and can go up to $50+/hr. Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. You can work as much as you want and will be paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.\n\nContract Length\n\nThis is a long-term contract with no end date. We expect to have work for the next 2 years. You can end the contract at any time, but we hope you will commit to 12 months of work.\n\nFlexible Schedules\n\nDevelopers can set their own hours. Ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. You will be assigned to projects, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but we are incredibly flexible on working hours. You can take a 3-hour lunch with no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.\n\nInterview Process\n• Apply using this Ashby form.\n• If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.\n• You’ll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We’re doing regular calls to answer any further questions about onboarding, as well as providing a support team at your disposal.\n• You’ll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be the final stage, which will ultimately determine your leveling and which project you’ll be assigned. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.\n\nTech Stack Priorities\n\nThe current priority for this team is frontend engineers who are well versed in JavaScript, React, and modern web development frameworks and libraries.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n• 3+ years of experience in a software engineering/software development role.\n• Strong proficiency with JavaScript/React and frontend development.\n• Complete fluency in the English language.\n• Ability to articulate complex technical concepts clearly and engagingly.\n• Excellent attention to detail and ability to maintain consistency in writing. Solid understanding of grammar, punctuation, and style guidelines.\n\nNice To Haves:\n• Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science.\n• Experience with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries (Next.js, Vue, Angular).\n• Familiarity with frontend testing frameworks (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress).\n• Knowledge of state management solutions (Redux, Context API, MobX).\n• Experience with TypeScript and modern frontend tooling.\n• Recognized accomplishments or contributions to the coding community or in projects.\n• Proven analytical skills with an ability to approach problems creatively.\n• Adept communication skills, especially when understanding and discussing project requirements.\n• A commitment to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest coding advancements and best practices.\n• Enthusiasm for teaching AI models and experience with technical writing!\n\nIf you're passionate about JavaScript, React, and the future of frontend development, this is an excellent opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge AI technology while leveraging your expertise!",

Period.\n\nNice to Have\n• Experience with TypeScript across the stack\n• Exposure to Next.js, Nest.js, or Apollo Client\n• Familiarity with Docker, Kubernetes, and container orchestration\n\nWhy LyveCom\n• Ship high-impact features used by top DTC brands\n• Work on a next-gen product that’s shaping the future of eCommerce\n• Join a product-obsessed team that iterates fast, and skips the red tape\n• Be part of a NASDAQ-listed company with startup speed\n\nReady to build the future of shoppable video?

    "job_description": "GitLab is an open core software company that develops the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps Platform, used by more than 100,000 organizations. Our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly accelerating the rate of human progress. This mission is integral to our culture, influencing how we hire, build products, and lead our industry. We make this possible at GitLab by running our operations on our product and staying aligned with our values. Learn more about Life at GitLab.\n\nThanks to products like Duo Enterprise, and Duo Workflow, customers get the benefit of AI at every stage of the SDLC. The same principles built into our products are reflected in how our team works: we embrace AI as a core productivity multiplier. All team members are encouraged and expected to incorporate AI into their daily workflows to drive efficiency, innovation, and impact across our global organisation.\n\nAn overview of this role\n\nSupport Engineering at GitLab isn’t just a title - you will be embedded within the Engineering department and will truly operate in an environment where Support and Engineering meet. You’ll interact with customers daily as they encounter the difficult edge cases of running GitLab in complex environments. In the space of a day, you might be doing behind the scenes work of a Linux administrator troubleshooting performance problems by using strace on a particular process, interacting with the Product team to ensure that steps in a bug report are reproducible, or interacting with the Engineering team itself by diving deep into our codebase and putting together a merge request to actually fix a customer issue.\n\nThat’s not all though - you’d equally be invited to contribute to the source code, improve our documentation, and help build out more efficient support processes in our issue tracker. We want to live in a world where everyone can contribute, and as a member of the Support team, there are no barriers to using your skills to improve the experience of our users and customers.\n\nSome examples of our projects:\n• A tool to quickly analyze strace output\n• A solution to capture the state of a customer’s server for easier troubleshooting\n• A tool which turns log files into interactive tables to easily sort and filter columns\n• A functionality to ChatOps to make it easier to identify user accounts on GitLab.com\n\nWhat you’ll do\n• Support a mix of Self-managed and GitLab.com (SaaS) customers and resolve their issues via Zendesk tickets, merge requests, email and video conferencing\n• Collaborate with our Product, Development, Infrastructure, Customer Success and Sales Teams to build new features and fix bugs, define and shape the product goals, roadmap, priorities, and strategy\n• Create and update documentation based on customer interactions\n• Collaborate with Support team members (through Pairing Sessions) and other GitLab team members (for example: as a Support Stable Counterpart)\n• Participate in regular rotations for weekday and weekend on-call coverage (daytime only), providing emergency support to our Self-managed and SaaS customers, or working with our SaaS Production team to coordinate incident communications\n\nWhat you’ll bring\n• Experience in and passion for managing customer-facing cases throughout the entire support lifecycle from initial customer inquiry to triage and reproduction, writing bug reports for handoff to the development team, and case resolution\n• Basic Linux systems knowledge\n• Basic familiarity/knowledge of scripting languages (preferably Ruby or Bash)\n• Basic understanding of Git\n• Ability to communicate technical topics to customers and coworkers of varying technical skill level\n\nAbout the team\n\nThe Support team is distributed all over the world across AMER, EMEA, and APAC regions. Support Engineers work on Support Tickets and helping GitLab’s customers, but they also dig into the code and logs to find out why something is not working as expected. The Collaboration here at GitLab is extraordinary and exciting - Support Engineers solve complex problems together and participate in regular pairing sessions and 1:1s, as well as coffee chats and Slack conversations that help them stay connected.\n\nThanks to our Transparency value, you can see what we are working on in our Support Team page. Additionally, you can see our company roadmap and listen to some of our meetings.\n\nHow GitLab will support you\n• Benefits to support your health, finances, and well-being\n• All remote, asynchronous work environment\n• Flexible Paid Time Off\n• Team Member Resource Groups\n• Equity Compensation & Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n• Growth and development budget\n• Parental leave\n• Home office support\n\nPlease note that we welcome interest from candidates with varying levels of experience; many successful candidates do not meet every single requirement. Additionally, studies have shown that people from underrepresented groups are less likely to apply to a job unless they meet every single qualification. If you're excited about this role, please apply and allow our recruiters to assess your application.\n#LI-JM1\n\nThe base salary range for this role’s listed level is currently for residents of listed locations only. Grade level and salary ranges are determined through interviews and a review of education, experience, knowledge, skills, abilities of the applicant, equity with other team members, and alignment with market data. See more information on our benefits and equity. Sales roles are also eligible for incentive pay targeted at up to 100% of the offered base salary.\n\nCalifornia/Colorado/Hawaii/New Jersey/New York/Washington/DC/Illinois/Minnesota pay range\n\n$58,200—$124,800 USD\n\nCountry Hiring Guidelines: GitLab hires new team members in countries around the world. All of our roles are remote, however some roles may carry specific location-based eligibility requirements. Our Talent Acquisition team can help answer any questions about location after starting the recruiting process.\n\nPrivacy Policy: Please review our Recruitment Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us.\n\nGitLab is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.

Over 150+ million developers, including more than 90% of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to collaborate and experiment across 420+ million repositories. repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code.\n\nLocations\n\nIn this role you can work from Remote, United States\n\nOverview\n\nGitHub is the home for software development, where we collaborate to build the world's leading AI-powered developer platform.\n\nIn the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about ensuring the security and quality of the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure and improve the quality of software is to detect actionable issues early in the development process, and actively facilitate their remediation as part of the developer workflow.\n\nOur team develops CodeQL and Copilot Autofix, detection and remediation engines that power the GitHub code scanning product, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day as part of GitHub's Advanced Security offering.\n• CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift.\n• Copilot Autofix is GitHub's LLM-powered remediation engine that produces high-quality fix suggestions for code scanning alerts, empowering developers to fix alerts as soon as they are found or that already exist in their codebase.\n\nWe work as a distributed group within a distributed company. The majority of our team members live across Europe, the US, and Canada, and while we do have some offices, all our meetings are location-agnostic and happen online. We operate with a high degree of autonomy and trust, and we have a significant level of influence on the product and technical direction of CodeQL, code scanning, and the broader set of security products at GitHub.
